## Notes
### Points I took into account when designing

- Differentiating the categories from the others by making them more appealing and intuitive
- I excluded the CRM chat category to create a floating virtual chat button for the user.
- Identifying the user and interacting with them from the moment they enter the administration system, thus making the user feel more comfortable with the software
- I increased the size of the notification icons to distinguish them from the rest of the components.
- The color used was chosen through the official Lizto website, it's the most commonly used color. Typically, a software's color palette depends on the colors in the logo, but the choice of this color is appropriate, it adds a sense of harmony to the system, and it feels eye-catching without being overly so.
- I added a component in the shortcuts section. I believe it's useful because not all users use certain predefined shortcuts with the same frequency. It's also good to have control over them.
- It's not an outgoing design because the type of audience it's aimed at and the role for which the program was created were taken into account. The goal is to maintain harmony and appropriate hierarchy.
